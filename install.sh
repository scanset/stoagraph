# About piping this into your shell.
#
# You are installing a product whose entire argument is "do not trust — verify". It would be rude of us
# to then ask you to execute an unread script from the internet. So:
#
#   * This script is IN the repo, at the tag it installs. What you read is what runs.
#   * It downloads a released binary and VERIFIES its SHA-256 against the published checksums before
#     executing anything. If the checksum does not match, it stops.
#   * The checksums file is signed (cosign, keyless). Verifying that signature is one command, printed
#     at the end, and we would rather you ran it.
#   * Nothing is installed with sudo unless you point it at a directory that needs it.
#
# If you would rather read first (you should; we would):
#
#   curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scanset/stoagraph/v0.1.2/install.sh
#   less install.sh && sh install.sh

  Next:

    stoagraph up      mint your control-plane role secrets, pull the signed images, start

  Then open the console at http://localhost:3000 (the login link is printed by 'up') and wire your
  first tool from the empty state, or start from examples/custom-tool.

  Verify what you just installed (we would):

    cosign verify-blob --signature checksums.txt.sig --certificate checksums.txt.pem \\
      --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/$REPO/.*' \\
      --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com checksums.txt

    cosign verify ghcr.io/$REPO/stag-serve:$VERSION \\
      --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/$REPO/.*' \\
      --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
