# The one that matters: the orchestrator never receives the console/approve secret, so it can never
# forge a human decision. It waits on a human; it cannot be one.
#
#   STAG_CONSOLE_TOKEN     the human's gate key — author policy + approve. (compose maps it to
#                          STAG_ADMIN_TOKEN and STAG_APPROVE_TOKEN.)
#   HARNESS_OPERATOR_TOKEN the human's orchestrator key — models + dispatch.
#   STAG_DISPATCH_TOKEN    MACHINE ONLY — the orchestrator process binds sessions with it. Never typed.
#
# Prefer `stoagraph up`, which does this and prints a one-click login link.

# defaults point into examples/, which a released install does not have, and Docker would create that
# missing path as a directory, mount it over /app/tools.yaml and crash-loop the server.
