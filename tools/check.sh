# grepping the command's output, so on a cold module cache `go: downloading modernc.org/...` (progress
# chatter on stderr) was read as a vet diagnostic and CI failed a clean tree. A check that cries wolf is
# a check people learn to ignore, which is worse than no check at all. Exit codes are the contract; the
