# tools/sbom.sh — a Software Bill of Materials for what we actually SHIP, plus a licence gate.
#
# A security control that cannot tell you what is inside it is asking for trust it has not earned.
#
# It scans the CONTAINER IMAGES, not the source tree — and that distinction matters. A dev's
# node_modules and the lockfile both contain `sharp` (LGPL-3.0), because npm resolves it as an optional
# transitive dep of Next. The console image does NOT: it is removed at build time, since the console
# never uses next/image. Scanning the source would therefore report a copyleft obligation that is not
# in the artifact, and scanning the artifact is the only thing that answers "what am I running?".
#
# The copyleft gate has already earned its keep — it is what surfaced that sharp was being shipped at
# all (33MB, LGPL, for a feature we do not use), and with it a build-context leak that was baking a
# developer's laptop node_modules into a published image.
