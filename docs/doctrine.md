# StoaGraph doctrine

*What StoaGraph does, in plain terms, and the beliefs it is built on.*

## The one line

> **StoaGraph does not stop prompt injection. It stops prompt injection from turning into action.**

Everything below is a consequence of taking that sentence seriously.

## What it is

StoaGraph is **verifiable control for AI agents**. An agent *proposes* a tool call; a deterministic
gate *disposes* — allow, deny, or escalate — with **no model in the decision path**. A hijacked,
prompt-injected, or simply wrong model can propose anything. It cannot make the gate release a value
your policy rejects.

> The model has a flashlight. The gate has the map.

Two processes, and the split *is* the product:

- **`stag`** — the **gate**. Deterministic policy, audit, approvals. Holds no model and no API keys.
- **`harness`** — the **orchestrator**. The model connections and the agent loop. Holds the keys.

The dependency runs one way — `harness → stag`, never back — and the build fails if that is ever
violated. So a compromised orchestrator can waste money and propose freely; it cannot reach the gate's
decisions or your policy.

## The problem it solves

Agents are being handed real tools — deploy, refund, delete, reroute, email. The moment an agent can
*act*, every document it reads becomes an attack surface: a log line, a ticket, a web page, a "runbook"
can all carry an instruction, and the model cannot reliably tell an instruction it was given from one it
merely read. You cannot train this away, and you cannot allow-list your way out of it, because the
danger is not *which* tool the agent uses — it is *what argument* it passes.

StoaGraph's move is to stop trying to make the model trustworthy and instead make its **actions**
provable: a human writes a policy of exactly which values each tool may receive, and a deterministic
gate enforces it on every call, forever, regardless of what the model was talked into.

## The tenets

1. **Propose / dispose.** The model proposes; the gate disposes. The two are separate processes with a
   one-way dependency. The thing that decides is not the thing that can be fooled.

2. **No model in the enforcement path.** A verdict is a pure function of the recipe (your policy) and the
   proposed arguments. Same inputs, same verdict, every time — auditable and reproducible.

3. **Complete mediation, both channels.** Every governed tool call (an **act**) and every context read (a
   **read**) crosses the gate. There is no forward path around it.

4. **Fail closed.** Unrouted tool, missing or malformed argument, unreachable downstream, un-lintable
   recipe, unknown token, empty credential — all **deny**. There is no configuration in which uncertainty
   produces an allow. A fresh gate permits *nothing* until you author a policy.

5. **Presume every proposal untrusted; re-derive trust at the sink.** StoaGraph does not track "taint"
   through the model — that cannot be done, and pretending otherwise is how systems get breached.
   Untrusted context is *positioned* as data going in (it can never reach the instruction slot), and every
   value coming out is presumed untrusted until a policy rule clears it at the action boundary. See
   [context-binding.md](context-binding.md).

6. **The recipe is the policy.** A human writes, per tool, the closed set of values each argument may
   take — `set_membership`, `numeric_range`, or a `signed_equality` token. Only a rule firing promotes a
   value from untrusted to released, and only the exact allowed values pass. "Close enough" does not.

7. **Coverage.** Every argument that can reach a tool is either gated by a rule or explicitly declared
   free-text. An argument that is neither is a hole — and the gate denies the call rather than forward it.

8. **Forward-iff-cleared.** A call reaches the downstream tool only on `allow`. `deny`, `escalate`, and
   `fault` never touch it.

9. **Human approval that cannot be forged.** An escalation is released only by an ed25519 signature bound
   to that exact action, minted by a human with the `approve` role and consumed on use. The orchestrator
   holds a different credential and **cannot approve itself** — otherwise the human gate would be
   decorative while every test still passed.

10. **Tamper-evident audit.** Every decision is appended to a hash-chained log; anyone can recompute it
    (`stag-verify`) and checkpoints can be signed for offline proof. The audit is the product, not a
    byproduct: "here is what was proposed, what was decided, and why" — verifiable, not asserted.

11. **A bounded, computable leak.** Even a closed-set gate leaves the model a *choice* among the allowed
    values — a residual channel. StoaGraph computes a signed number that ceilings it (`recipe.Leakage`),
    and refuses — with `-require-bounded` — to serve a policy whose leak is not bounded. No competitor
    emits this number.

12. **Open by construction.** Apache-2.0, the whole product, no held-back edition. A control that asks you
    to "don't trust — verify" has to be verifiable, all the way down.

## What StoaGraph does *not* do

- It does **not** stop the model from being fooled. Prompt injection still happens; the model may still
  propose the wrong thing. StoaGraph makes that proposal inconsequential.
- It does **not** taint-track values through the model. That is deliberate — the guarantee would be a
  fiction. Trust is re-derived at the sink instead.
- It is **not** a model firewall, a jailbreak detector, or a content classifier. It never inspects
  meaning; it checks values against a policy.
- It does **not** defend a host whose disk or memory an attacker already controls. The recipe store, the
  keys, and the gate are trusted infrastructure. (See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full
  non-goals.)

## The shape of the guarantee

Read a poisoned page, get fooled, propose the forbidden action — and the gate denies the argument on a
tool you were fully allowed to call, records it on a chain you can verify, and never lets it reach the
world. The injection changed what was *proposed*. It did not change what was *permitted*.

That is the doctrine: **stop prompt injection from turning into action.**
