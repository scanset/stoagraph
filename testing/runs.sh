# runs.sh — the SCRIPTED, model-independent runs of the test matrix (Runs 1, 3, 4).
#
# No model is involved on purpose: these prove properties of the GATE itself, deterministically.
#   Run 1  Unreachability      — an unrouted tool is absent from tools/list AND fail-closed denied.
#   Run 3  Escalate->approve   — a consequential tool is HELD, a human mints a signed release, the
#                                retry with the token forwards, and the release is consumed ONE time.
#   Run 4  Fingerprint binding — that approval cannot be replayed against a DIFFERENT action.
# Every call's verdict is printed next to tools/list, and the whole thing ends with a VERIFIED audit
# chain (stag-verify recomputes every leaf). See run.sh for the LIVE argument-abuse deny (Run 2).

note RUN 1 — Unreachability. wipe_database has NO route. It must be absent from tools/list, and a direct call must fail-closed deny.

note RUN 3 — Escalate. isolate_host is advertised + routed, but consequential: no approval -> HELD, nothing forwarded.
call ops__isolate_host {"host":"web-01"}
approve
note RUN 4 — Fingerprint binding. Replay the approval (minted for web-01) against a DIFFERENT host. Different fingerprint -> it must NOT transfer.
call ops__isolate_host {"host":"db-99","approval_token":"$TOKEN"}
note RUN 3 (cont.) — the approved action itself: the retry carries the token, the release resolves, the call forwards.
call ops__isolate_host {"host":"web-01","approval_token":"$TOKEN"}
note RUN 3 (cont.) — one-time: replay the SAME token for the SAME action. The release was consumed; it re-escalates.
