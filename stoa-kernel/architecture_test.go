// Package stoakernel_test holds the architectural invariants of the merged module (Planning/26).
//
// Merging the gate and the orchestrator into one Go module bought a simpler build — but it removed
// the module boundary that USED to make the central claim structurally true. These tests put that
// boundary back as an enforced rule, so the claim cannot quietly rot into a convention.

// TestGateDependsOnNothingInTheOrchestrator is the load-bearing architectural test.
//
// The product's central claim is that the GATE holds no model and no keys — that is why it can be
// trusted to enforce policy on an untrusted agent, and why it ships as its own container. That claim
// is only credible if the gate cannot even REACH the orchestrator's code (models, API keys, the agent
// loop). The dependency runs ONE WAY: harness -> stag, never the reverse.
//
// If this test fails, someone has imported orchestrator code into the gate. That is not a style
// problem; it is the product-defining invariant breaking, and no amount of "but it works" makes it
// safe to ship.
