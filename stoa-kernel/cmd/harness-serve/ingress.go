// webhook is the event front door (Planning/32, I2): an external source POSTs a signed delivery, the
// generic HMAC adapter verifies the channel and normalizes it to an Envelope, the arrival is recorded
// to the hash-chained ingress log REGARDLESS of disposition, and an attributed + matched event is
// resolved to a recipe by the deterministic event map (lane 1 — no model on the front door). The
// resolved run is handed to the same governed pipeline the console's /api/dispatch uses.
//
// This handler NEVER enforces and NEVER fires an actuator (Planning/13): it verifies its channel,
// records, and routes. A misroute or a forged event is contained downstream by the gate.
//
// Disposition, always recorded:
//   - "dropped:shape"        the body was unparseable/oversize (adapter error) -> 400
//   - "dropped:unattributed" a definition matched but requires attribution the event lacks -> 202
//   - "dropped:no-route"     nothing in the event map matched -> 202
//   - "dispatched:<recipe>"  an attributed (or attribution-not-required) match -> 200
