// Package adapterauth resolves a stored MCP server into the connect-time credential the gate injects
// downstream. It is the single place that maps the oauth scheme to a fresh bearer token (refreshing if
// needed); bearer, header, query, and none pass straight through. Keeping this in one leaf package lets
// every connect site (stag-proxy enforcement, stag-serve discovery) share the same resolution without
// duplicating the oauth branch — and without mcpgate needing to know about the token store.
