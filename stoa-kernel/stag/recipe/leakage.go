// file-kw: leakage choice-channel covert bound forwarded-tuples logsumexp foreach-geom per-call existence session

// Leakage computes the CHOICE-CHANNEL bound for a recipe: how much a fully prompt-injected model could
// exfiltrate to an external observer through the *choices* it makes among what the gate ALLOWS. Even a
// closed-set gate lets the model pick WHICH allowed value crosses; the gate does not remove that
// channel, it makes it BOUNDED and STATICALLY COMPUTABLE — a signed number no competitor can produce.
//
// The model was DERIVED AND ADVERSARIALLY VERIFIED (2026-07-15): five independent lenses attacked a
// naive Σ log2(K_i) bound and an adjudicator corrected it. The corrections that matter:
//   - A recipe governs ONE tool call. F(R) = the number of distinct FORWARDED value-tuples of that
//     call = product of each gated arg's admitted-value count along a path, SUMMED over branches
//     (the attacker may take any), with a foreach body contributing a geometric series over its
//     iteration cap. This is log2-domain: sink=+log2(c), branch=logsumexp, foreach=logGeom.
//   - EXISTENCE is per-CALL, not per-sink: the model can force the whole call to deny (propose a
//     failing value), and "not forwarded" is one observable outcome. So a call carries F(R)+1
//     outcomes -> CallBits = log2(F(R)+1). A signed_equality-only call therefore leaks 1 bit, not 0.
//   - A benign/ruleless sink of a slot a GATE already constrained is NOT free text (the value was
//     bounded upstream); it is free text -> UNBOUNDED only if its slot was never constrained.
//   - A free-text `passthrough` argument VOIDS the bound (unbounded). The leakage bound exists exactly
//     when every output-reaching argument is closed-set — the same theorem as the coverage contract.
//
// Session-level composition (N such calls across M advertised recipes) is SessionBound(); ordering is
// SUBSUMED by the length-<=N sequence count (do NOT add log2(N!)).
//
// STATED PRECONDITIONS for the number to be a real ceiling (see the design doc): canonical-only
// release (enforced), an order-only / log-private / semantic-value observer, and — not yet enforced —
// a gate-side per-session crossing cap N and an advertise-time refusal of unbounded recipes. The
// number is a per-session RATE, not a lifetime guarantee.
