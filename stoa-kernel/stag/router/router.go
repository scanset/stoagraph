// Package router resolves the persisted route table (Planning/18) into a live

// stored route binds a tool to a recipe BY NAME + a gated arg; Build loads and
// parses each recipe into the kernel form. Fail closed: a route whose recipe is
// missing or invalid produces NO router entry (and an error) — the tool is left
// unrouted, which the gate denies (U22). The router never holds a broken recipe.
