// Package dispatch routes an EVENT to a RECIPE, then (slice 2) binds a session and runs the agent
// loop against it. It is the orchestration analog of stag's own gate — and a port of Ratchet's
// dispatcher (internal/dispatch): the model proposes into a constrained slot (a recipe id from an
// enum) and a deterministic Gate decides. Resolution is deterministic-first: a user-authored event
// map matches structured events with no model at all; only unmatched/ambiguous events fall through
// to the dispatch model.
//
// Load-bearing property (Planning/25): a MISROUTE CANNOT BREACH. If the dispatcher picks the wrong
// recipe, stag still enforces THAT recipe faithfully — a bad route wastes a turn, it never lets
// anything cross. That is why a model is allowed in the routing path: the gate is the backstop.
