// Package skill resolves a bound skill to a TRUST SLOT (Planning/33, C3). A skill is a
// content-addressed procedure bundle; the harness verifies its ed25519 signature against the
// OPERATOR's public key and, only if it verifies, places it in the instruction (System) slot. An
// unsigned or badly-signed skill degrades to the untrusted Input slot — a lying procedure can then
// inform a proposal but never instruct the agent, and it still cannot act (every proposal hits the
// gate). This is the ClawHub failure mode (malicious marketplace skills) turned into a non-event.
//
// The load-bearing property (Planning/30 doctrine, preserved): trust comes from cryptography the
// HARNESS checks, never from a label the channel asserts. The gate serves the bytes + signature; this
// package decides the slot.
